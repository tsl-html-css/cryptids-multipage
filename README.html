<p>You&#39;ve created your Cryptids page. Nice job.</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s time to branch out. Literally. Your team will choose one of the Cryptids and build out a page about that Cryptid. You&#39;ll do this on a branch. When you&#39;re done, you&#39;ll make a pull request to merge it back into the master branch.</p>
<h3 id="here-s-what-you-ll-need-to-do-">Here&#39;s what you&#39;ll need to do:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Your team will choose your Cryptid</li>
<li>Sketch &amp; wireframe what your Cryptid&#39;s page will look like.</li>
<li>Find content about your Cryptid on Wikipedia or other sources online.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="technical-requirements-">Technical requirements:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use a body class to make your Cryptid&#39;s name in the nav &quot;active&quot; on your page.</li>
<li>The first section of your page should be a full-screen image of your Cryptid with its name overlayed on top.</li>
<li>Include at least 3 additional images of your cryptid</li>
<li>One of your images should float</li>
<li>Create a two column list of facts about your Cryptid</li>
<li>Create an intake form for sightings of your Cryptid. Ask for first and last name, email address, time, date, location, and radio buttons for whether it was found on land, at sea, or in the air. </li>
<li>In the form, using only HTML, put focus on the first name field.</li>
</ul>
