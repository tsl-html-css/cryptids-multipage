            <li>The jackalope - part jack-rabbit, part antelope - is a mythical animal of North American folklore.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The Herrick brothers, hunters in 1930s Wyoming, popularized the jackalope by grafting deer antlers onto jackrabbit carcasses and selling them.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Stuffed and mounted jackalopes are found in many bars and other places; there are also postcards and other paraphernalia.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Jackalopes are featured in books, movies, music, video games; there is even a hockey team and a brewery named after the creature.</li>
            <br>
            <li>It became such a part of pop-culture that the Wyoming Legislature has considered bills to make it the stateâ€™s official mythological creature.</li>
            </ul>

            <aside>
            <ul>
            <li>The underlying legend might be inspired by historic sightings of rabbits infected with the Shope Papilloma virus, which causes horn-like tumors to grow on their bodies.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Tall tales abound: hunters can be gored to death by jackalopes, they only breed during lightning flashes; they can mimic human voices and often sing at night; you can catch one by enticing it with whiskey.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The jackalope is an example of the American Tall Tale in which a local community, through a combination of hoax and media activity, draws attention to itself for social or economic reasons.</li>
